# TestRepo
Author: Claudia Woodruff
Date Created: September 10, 2017

Description: TestRepo is a repository created by me, Claudia Woodruff, in order to learn about git and github. 
After creating TestRepo, our assignment is to create this README, and load a text file or screenshot of my data science profile 
along with the rmarkdown created in our previous unit assignment.
