# Introduction
Doing Data Science Week 2
This R markdown document gives the code and output on some basic analysis of stackloss dataset.
  * stack.loss
  * Air.Flow
# Code

```{r}
attach(stackloss)
summary(stackloss)
str(stackloss)
```

## Including Plots

```{r echo=FALSE}
plot(stack.loss ~ Air.Flow, main="stack.loss v. Air.Flow", col="blue")
abline(lm(stack.loss ~ Air.Flow,), col="red")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
